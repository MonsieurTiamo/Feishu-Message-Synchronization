# Feishu-Message-Synchronization
This is a program to synchronize local excel files to Feishu Multi-Dimensional Forms Cloud Documents.

There are often such application scenarios in enterprises, sending emails inviting cooperation to a large number of customers or social media celebrities, and need to record the people who have replied and their relevant information.

We assume that the local excel has all the information of the sent emails, and we need to record the information of the people who have replied in the Feishu  Multi-dimensional Forms Cloud Document. With this program, simply enter one tag in the cloud document, such as their email address, and the other information can be automatically synchronized from local to write in the cloud document.

Thank you for visiting this repository.
